line 15 should be snake case
line 16 should read ==
line 23 should say def and parameters should be separated by a comma
line 25 should read card1.value
line 27 should have a return statement and should also read card2.value
line 30 has an extra end statement
line 32 self. statement not required
line 33 variable total is not initiated should read total = 0
line 36 variable total should be converted to a string. Also return statement should be outside of loop and have a space after the word 'of' for ease of reading
line 39 is missing an end statement
